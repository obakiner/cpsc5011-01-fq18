w1 {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, w2 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Demo dollar amounts -- should be 0 and 8.46
{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} 0
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} 8.46

Adding w1 and w2
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Adding w2 and w2
{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}

Adding a constant -- should be a 18.46
18.46

Subtract .06 from w2 -- should subtract a nickle and penny, result is 8.40
  {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5} 8.4
Subtract 7.30 from w2 result should be 1.16
  {0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 6} 1.16

Access array elements of w2 one by one 
1  2  3  4  5  6  
Test equality with {0, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0} and {0, 0, 2, 10, 5, 20}

w3 and w4 should be equal
1.95 1.95
1

w2 and w4 should not be equal
