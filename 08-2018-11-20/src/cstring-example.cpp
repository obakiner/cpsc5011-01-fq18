 * 		by a special null character \0
 * 		This is fine as long as
 * 		  * every time you create a string you append a null character
 * 		  * you use string libraries that respect the null
 * 		Two example of C string libraries
 * 		  * strcmp -- compare two strings
 * 		  * strncat -- concatenate two strings
