This is exercise 5.16 from Gaddis

Savings Account Balance

Write a program that calculates the balance of a savings account at the end of a period
of time.  It shold ask the user for the annual interest rate, the starting balance, and the
number of months that have passed since the account was established.  A loop should then 
iterate once for every month, performing the following

A) Ask the user for amount depostied into the account during the month.  Do not accept negative numbers.
This amount should be added to the balance.
B) Ask fthe user for the amount withdrawn from the account during the month.  Do not accept negative numbers.
C) Calculate the monthly interest.  The monthly interest rate is the anual interest rate divided by twelve.
Multiply the monthly interest rate by the balance, and add the result to the balance.

After the last iteration, the program should display the ending balance, the total amount of 
deposits, the total number of withdrawals, and the total intersest earned.

If that's easy explore formatting output to make things prettier:


These numbers are wrong -- just go after the formatting!


Interest rate: 1.25%
Number of months:  6
Total 
   Deposits     $156.25
   Withdrawals    45.00
   Interest        0.62
--------------------------
End balance     $201.25
