Making Change

Engage in the following dialogue with the user.  

		How much is the item you are buying?    3.27
		How many $5 bills? 1
		How many $1 bills? 3
		
		Tax is .32, total is $3.59,  change is $2.41
		
		You get 
		  2 $1 bills
		  1 quarter
		  1 dime
		  1 nickel
		  1 penny
  
Assume payment is only in $5 bills and $1 bills, and change is only 
in $1 bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.  
Do not allow negative numbers, or fractional number of $5 bills or $1 bills.
You don't have to pluralize the change correctly unless you want to.
