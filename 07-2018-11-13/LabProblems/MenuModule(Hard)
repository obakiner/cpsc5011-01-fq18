This is a module that will do menu selection for you in a console app.

The function is

int menuChoice(string header, vector<string> options, string prompt);

For example if my prompt were:   "Make a selection:"
and my header were "What operation do you want:"
and my choices were "Deposit", "Withdraw", "Balance"

then calling the menu would display

		What operation do you want:
		  1.  Deposit
		  2.  Withdraw
		  3.  Balance
		
		Make a selection (-1 to quit):  

Then it would keep prompting the user until it got a number between 1 and 3, or a -1,
catching and printing an error message on invalid or out of bounds input.
The return value would be either -1, or a number between 0 and 2. 
Note this is one less than the input -- it's the index in the vector corresponding to the choice.
